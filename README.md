# Thompson's Construction

The purpose of this project is to implement the so-called Thompson's construction algorithm, which is 
used to create, from an arbitrary regular expression, an NFA, i.e., a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton.
An NFA is basically a graph, which is used in combination with a graph traversal algorithm, to 
determine whether an input word belongs to the language recognized by the automaton, i.e., whether
the input word belongs to the language denoted by the original regular expression.
